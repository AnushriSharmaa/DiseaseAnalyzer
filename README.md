# 🩺 Disease Analyzer

*Disease Analyzer* is a web-based application that allows users to input their health symptoms and receive a list of possible diseases that match those symptoms. It is built as an awareness tool to help users become more informed about their potential health risks — and it encourages them to consult with medical professionals for an accurate diagnosis.


## 🚀 Features

✅ Enter multiple symptoms (comma-separated)  
✅ Get a list of possible matching diseases   
✅ User-friendly
✅ Fully responsive (mobile + tablet + desktop)  
✅ Animations and interactivity for better UX  

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user inputs one or more symptoms into the provided text field.
2. The app processes the symptoms by comparing them against a list of dataset.
3. The diseases that have at least one matching symptom are returned as results.
4. The user is encouraged to consult a doctor for professional advice.
